The Open Source Technique for Belief Mapping.

Belief Mapping is easy. Here's how.

# The Short Version

* **Choose a topic, a time and a place; and invite participants (and, optionally, speakers).**
* **At the event, ask people to record on whiteboards or flipcharts how their beliefs on the subject compare**, writing down their points of agreement, disagreement and unknowns. 2 or 3 hours is a good length.
* Optionally:Â **record the outcome and share it with others.**
* Optionally: **schedule a follow-on.**

# The (Slightly) Longer Version

# How To Contribute
Belief mapping is open source, which means you can contribute to its design. The driving principles of Belief Mapping are that:

1. Belief Mapping sessions should be dead easy to organise and run;
1. they should be fun for participants;
1. the outcomes should tend towards truth.
